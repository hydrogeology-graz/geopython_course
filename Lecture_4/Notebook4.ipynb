    "In this notebook we will learn how to write reusable pieces of Python code: functions. Python functions are extremely useful when we need to perform a certain operation or calculation multiple times. Together with the for-loops and conditional statements from the last lecture Python functions form some of the core functionality that makes programming so usefull. Additionally to functions, We will also learn how to read csv (comma separated variables) files, a common format to store spreadsheet data, using Numpy."

    "Functions are fundamental building blocks in most programming languages and are used to store repetitive sequences of code to perform a certain (single) task.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, we have already used quite a few functions throughout our Python programming course. Remember for example `np.sin`, `plt.plot`, or `type`? All of these were in fact functions that defined a piece of code to perform a certain task. Python packages can also be seen as a collection of functions for tasks we have to perform more often, such as calculating the sine, plot a time series or discover the type of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is 'called' by typing in the function name, followed by an opening bracket (`(`), the functions' input arguments, and a closing round bracket (`)`). For example:"

    "In the above code-block we use the function `sin` within the numpy package to calculate the $\\sin$ of 2. The number 2 is the input argument, and `sin` is the function. Let's look how we can define a function ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function definition\n",
    "To define a function we start with writing `def` followed a space and then the name of the new function we want to create. The name can be anything but it is common practice to stick to letters, underscores (`_`) and sometimes numbers. It is also good practice to give the function a name that makes clear what the function does (as `multiply` above for example). There are a few function names that are already in use by the Python Standard Library, see additional readings for a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the function is followed by an opening bracket `(`, some input arguments, and a closing bracket `)` and a colon `:`. After the opening and closing brackets with the arguments in between, the actual operation begins in the code block starting on the next line, indented by four spaces or a tab. This is quite similar to how for-loops are written. Let's look at a working example:"

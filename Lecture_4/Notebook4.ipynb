Python functions are extremely useful when we need to perform a certain operation or calculation multiple times. Together with the for-loops and conditional statements from the last lecture Python functions form some of the core functionality that makes programming so usefull. Additionally to functions, We will also learn how to read csv (comma separated variables) files, a common format to store spreadsheet data, using Numpy."

All of these were in fact functions that defined a piece of code to perform a certain task. Python packages can also be seen as a collection of functions for tasks we have to perform more often, such as calculating the sine, plot a time series or discover the type of a variable.\n",

The name can be anything but it is common practice to stick to letters, underscores (`_`) and sometimes numbers. It is also good practice to give the function a name that makes clear what the function does (as `multiply` above for example). There are a few function names that are already in use by the Python Standard Library, see additional readings for a list.\n",

After the opening and closing brackets with the arguments in between, the actual operation begins in the code block starting on the next line, indented by four spaces or a tab.

    "So far, we have only worked with data that was directly defined in our Jupyter Notebook (see e.g., the list with numbers in the above code blocks). In real life however, we often need to import some data that has been stored in different types of files. A common format is CSV, or comma separated variables, files. These files can be recognized by the file extension .csv (e.g., `myfile.csv`).\n",

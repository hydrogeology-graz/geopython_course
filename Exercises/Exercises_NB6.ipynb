Note that if Evaporation exceeds Precipitation this may lead to negative groundwater recharge, which can be interpreted as evaporation from the groundwater.\n",

    "3. Define a function named `obj_function` that implements the sum of squared residuals formula from Notebook 6 and returns the value for the objective function. Make sure the input parameters make it possible to use scipy's `minimize` method in the next Exercise.\n",

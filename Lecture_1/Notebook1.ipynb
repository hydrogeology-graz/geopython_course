    "## 1. What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "If you can read this, you have already successfully opened a Jupyter Notebook (with file-extension `.ipynb`). Jupyter is an \"*open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.*\" (source: https://jupyter.org/). In this class, we will use Jupyter Notebooks to learn Python programming and share homework exercises. A good introduction on Jupyter Notebooks is given on the [Jupyter Notebook website](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html#basic-workflow).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks have become a common format to share research analyses in scientific studies and can be a great step towards reproducible science. The main advantage of Notebooks is that we can combine plain text with code, which can be executed right here in the document. Jupyter Notebooks don't just support Python code, but also over 50 other programming languages. The results of the code are directly visible inside the Notebook, keeping everything nicely in one place. We will use two types of cell types in the Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code cells**: cells with Python code that can be executed.\n",
    "- **Markdown cells**: cells with plain text (like this one), formatted in the Markdown language.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the unformatted markdown code of a markdown cell, double-click on the text (for example the text you are reading now). To format the text, press `Shift + Enter` simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Text in Markdown Cells \n",
    "As you can see above, the text boxes have various formatting options, such as *italic text*, **bold text**, [hyperlinks](https://www.uni-graz.at) or `code`. Unlike word-processing software (e.g., Microsoft Word), there are no buttons to click and format the text. Instead, you need to use a certain syntax to format the text. The syntax used for text-formatting in Jupyter Notebooks is called [_markdown_ or _markdown language_ ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). The guidelines on how to use it are found [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) or in every Notebook under the _Help_ tab at the top. Here are a few formatting options (double-click on the text to see the formatting):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **This is bold text.**\n",
    "- *But this text is in italics.*\n",
    "- and [here](https://www.uni-graz.at) is a link.\n",
    "- This can be used for `code`.\n",
    "- See the top of this block on how to include a figure!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Basic Python Syntax\n",
    "Move your cursor into the code-block below, and click the right mouse button. The code block is now selected, visible by the blue border-line of the code cell. To run the code, press Shift + Enter simultaneously (the answer should print 12). After you run a code block, a number will appear between the brackets left of the block (e.g., `[1]:`), and while it is calculating something an asterisk will appear (e.g., `[*]:`)."

    "## What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "If you can read this, you have already succesfully opened a Jupyter notebook (with file-extension `.ipynb`). Jupyter is an \"*open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.*\" (https://jupyter.org/). In this class, we will use Jupyter Notebooks to learn Python programming and share homework exercises. Jupyter Notebooks have also become a common format to share research analyses in scientific studies and can be a great step towards reproducible science. See for example [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/) in _the Atlantic_ for an easy, general overview aboout why this is a great step forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of Notebooks is that we can combine plain text with code, not just Python but, also over 50 other programming languages.\n",
    "Notebooks can be read in (or exported as) a static form with the computations already done, so that they just show how the results where obtained, just like the reports you wrote for the first part of this lecture.\n",
    "Their main benefit however is that the computations can be done (and changed) inside the notebook, with the results showing up in the notebook, right next to the code, with the additional benefit that there can be formated text next to it, giving further explantions about the code or the results, or, in our case, explanations on what you have to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use the text boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see above, the text boxes have various formatting options, such as *italic text*, **bold text**, [hyperlinks](https://www.uni-graz.at) or `code`.\n",
    "Unlike for example Microsoft Word, where you'd have some buttons to click on to tell the program that you now want to write a header, or in bold, you have to use formatting in your raw text. The line with the examples above was written like follows\n",
    "\n",
    "    such as *italic text_* **bold text**, [hyperlinks](https://www.uni-graz.at) or `code`.\n",
    "\n",
    "and gets interpreted by the notebook in order to look as intended.\n",
    "This syntax is called [_markdown_ or _markdown language_ ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), with jupyter notebooks using a variant used on the github platform.\n",
    "The guidelines on how to use it are found [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) or in every notebook under the _Help_ tab at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Running Python Code\n",
    "Move your cursor into a code-block and click the right mouse button, the code block is now selected. To run the code, press Shift + Enter simultaneously (the answer should print 12). After you run a code block, a number will appear between the brackets left of the block (e.g., `[1]:`), and while it is calculating something an asterisk will appear (e.g., `[*]:`).\n"

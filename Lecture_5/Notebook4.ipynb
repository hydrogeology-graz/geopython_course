    "`CSV` stands for *comma separated value(s)*, meaning that your csv file is just a text file (`.txt`) with a comma separating the values. E.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    apples,  USD, 5.99\n",
    "    oranges, USD, 7.99\n",

    "    Äpfel,   EUR, 5,36\n",
    "    \n",
    "So in Austria, the semicolon `;` tends to get used as the separator.\n",

    "### 2a. Common file types\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look around on your computer, you'll find various files, generally marked by a symbol/icon and their file extension. E.g a page of paper with a \"W\" and the ending `.doc` or `.docx` is a word file, if that \"W\" is an \"X\" and it ends with `.xls` or `.xlsx`, it's an excel file, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "So normally, you just doubleclick a file, and windows knows what to do with it, and thanks to the icon, you know what's likely going to happen (\"W\" indicates that word will start...). However, this system has some limitations:\n",
    "When you change the file ending, you don't necessarily change the file. And icons that point to specific applications can hide the fact that there's also other applications that can open said files.\n",
    "And as you have already realized, windows sometimes gets confused when saving files from the internet or when opening files it does not know. E.g. when Edge tries to save our notebooks as `.htm` or when you try to open our `.ipynb` files with a simple doubleclick.\n",
    "So this simple principle offers some pitfalls, when you venture away from the small bunch of standard MS-Office files or when you are working with files that can be opened with many different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways to improve this situation such as \"[magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming))\" and the use of metadata. However, for our use case, the file extension and a bit of thinking will work."
